Name of Project:
Class Assignment 3-Decision Tree Classifier

Project Overview:
This project uses the sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier to tran, test, and visualize multiple decision trees of varying hyperparameters in order to find the best fitting tree. 

Configuration/Installation Instructions:
To begin this project, you need to open a colab or Jupyter notebook and import the following packages: pandas as pd, seaborn as sns, sklearn preprocessing, sklearn.tree DecisionClassifier, and sklearn metrics.
Next, you can upload the Census Data.csv into a dataframe by using pd.read_csv('census_data.csv')

Files Included:
This assignment contains a README file, CA03-Decision Trees-Write Up PDF, census_data.csv, CA03_DecisionTrees.ipynb

Known Bugs:
AUC score in part 6  does not run due to unknown inputs, every tree performanc in part 7 is the exact same despite differeing hyperparameters, function to create hyperparameter table is incomplete, part 10 is uncomplete
